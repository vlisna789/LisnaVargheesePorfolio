						<p>This is a personal project I took on, where I choose a system I was innately familiar with, conducted a survey, performed an audit and performed a competitive analysis of other similar systems. In conclusion, based on my research,<b> created a whole new flow.</b>
	</p>
							<h3>Introduction to Marta</h3>
              <p>MARTA stands for Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. MARTA is Atlanta’s main transit system. </p>
            </div>
						<p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/whatismarta.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
						<p>If you are regular MARTA user, you would purchase a breeze card and reload your breeze card with a <i> MARTA kiosk.</i> The breeze card grants access to the ...</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>MARTA’s buses and trains</li>
						  <li>Cobb County Transit System</li>
						  <li>Gwinnett County System</li>
							<li>GTRA</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because of all the access the MARTA card has - <b> the kiosk has a lot of rules and flows.</b></p>
						<p>The MARTA kiosk flow has remained unchanged for years. In Atlanta, this system touches millions of workers' ability to get to their jobs and homes. Improving the flow of this system can decrease queue time, and can prevent users from interacting with other modes of transportation. If so, <b> the government will loose points of sale and carbon will be added to the environment due to an increase in car usage.</b> If we can improve this flow, we can bring more users to the machine, more users to the MARTA, less cars on the road and more government revenue. </p>
						<h3>User Pain Points</h3>
						<p>Considering the use of the machine, we know users are most likely in a rush to get to their location. Keeping that in mind when decreasing the flow, and prioritizing those who use it most can mitigate that pain of using the machine.</p>

						<h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>While designing this system I kept in mind two of my biggest limitations, <b> the physical buttons and the various access options the breeze card gave.</b> </p>
						<p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/About.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
						<p>Due to the fact that there are so many opportunities for your breeze card, the kiosk can be overwhelming. Not only are there too many options, but there is <b> no priority for commonly used user actions </b>, such as those who <b>own</b> a breeze card. </p>
						<p> Because the physical buttons were placed evenly on the screen and all equidistant from one other, I had no free choice over where to place the options.</p>
						 <h3>User Research</h3>
             <p>I created a short 10 question survey about users’ experience with the MARTA system. The questions were mulitple choice and a couple free anwser. I posted the survey on my facebook wall to get results from my communtity. From that survey I got 34 response and most of the responses were 18-35 years old.</p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/Data.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <p>In short, the results are</p>
					 <ul>
             <li>93% of users surveyed use the MARTA trains</li>
             <li>83% of users surveyed use the kiosk to reload their card</li>
             <li>70% of users surveyed buy either 2 trips or more trips</li>
             <li>60% of users surveyed complain that the kiosk lacks efficiency</li>
             <li>62% of users surveyed wish they could view the bus schedules on the kiosk</li>
           </ul>

					 <p>These results tell me what users 18-35 years old thought about the MARTA system. I know from this data <b> 93% users use trains</b>, that means I should prioritize the trains on this platform, as oppose to buses.
						 I also know most users use the machine to reload their card, as opposing to buying a ticket or buying a card, so <b> prioritizing those with a card.</b> I also see from this data that <b> most users buy a single or round trip</b> as oppose to mass loading money on their card, from that I am making sure I provide those options.</p>
				<h3>How Does Socio-Economic Background Factor Into This Design?</h3>
						<p>Looking at these survey results, I considered that most of my facebook friends were from a different socio-economic background than those who normally use MARTA. I researched what differences MARTA put into their flow to account for that.
						MARTA has discounted prices on <b>bulk money refills on the card</b> so providing an easy option to customize price was included in this. I also discovered that many people switch between trains, so loading a lot of money on their card is the easiest way to pay for that. Keeping that in mind I included a "Same-Day Transfer" option, to reduce the flow for those who do that. </p>

           <h3>Current MARTA Experience - Purchasing A Round Train Trip</h3>
					 <p><b>Screens</b> - this indicates how many screens the user had to interact with to purchase a round trip. </p>
					  <p><b>Physical Interactions</b> - Physical Interactions indicate how many times the user had to either swipe a card, press a button or interact with the keypad.</p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/13Screens.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
           <p>A MARTA rider, in order to purchase 2 trips ( otherwise known as a round trip and a basic purchase from the kiosk) has to go through 13 screens, and interact with the machine 11 times.</p>
           <h3>Recurring Usabilty Issues</h3>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/usbilityIssues1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>

           <h3>Changes</h3>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/changes.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
           <h3>New MARTA Experience - Feature Redesign</h3>
           <p>A MARTA rider, in order to purchase a standard trip in my new redesign has to go through 9 screens, and interact with the machine 7 times.</p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/9screens.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
           <h3>Major Usability Changes</h3>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/usabilitychanges.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/MartaRedesign/usabilitychanges2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>

             <h3>Potential Impact</h3>
             <p>The potential Impact of this flow could decrease service time per customer, decrease queue time overall and increase usability. All three of these aspects will lead to a happier user. </p>
						 <h3>Is this Implementation Possible?</h3>
							 Short answer - YES. I researched how other systems such as NYC metro, SEPTA metro, and the Boston T use their kiosks. For example, I know the flow can START with a card swipe because thats how SEPTA metro starts their flow. I know the zipcode option can appear <b>only if</b> the user selected credit card because the NYC Metro works. I also know it is uneccesary to swipe your Breeze card TWICE (which is what MARTA does, before and after purchase), because no other system does that. </p>
							 <h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
							 <ol>
								<li>DESIGN FOR SCALE. The reality is most of the people taking my survey did not take the marta regularly, so making sure my design was customizable and flexible for all users. I made sure to include at each point where the options might lie outside what was available, for example number of trips or "Same-Day Transfers", that an option was present to decrease any other users flow who didnt fit within the survey.</li>
	 						  <li>Data Driven Design. I have my own opinions of MARTA because I use the machine a lot, so taking my opinion out of problem and evaluating the results. </li>
								<li>Survey Design. Survey design requires a lot of mental work. I learned how to consider what ane enjoyable, clear and short survey would be. </li>
								<li>Working around business requirements. MARTA's constraints included their rules on "Same-day Transfers" and the machine had 10 buttons total for interaction. Considering those limitations made this project challenging in the best ways.</li>
								<li>Audit. I learned how to audit a system. From flow, to usabilty features to copy, I took apart this machine.</li>
