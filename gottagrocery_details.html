					<p>GottaGrocery main purpose as a system is to assist the average grocery shopper with his/her weekly grocery runs, it aims to improve the shopper’s overall experience by saving money and time.</p>

					<div class="testimony animate-box">
							<h3>Overview of System</h3>
              <p>Our system aims to create a more seamless experience for the average grocery shopper. This application serves to make sure the user saves time and money while shopping, by keeping a log of what the user usually buys. After each trip to the grocery store, the user uploads the receipt. The app will</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>recognize these products and remind the shopper what he or she usually buys at that location</li>
							  <li>look for discounts on what the user normally buys and suggest similar items</li>
							  <li>recommend when the user may need to go grocery shopping again</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>Why does this matter?</b>This will prevent the user from forgetting items after shopping and will help them save money while shopping. For the grocery store who participates in this system, users are more likely to return to that store after having a pleasant experience. As a system that is trying to assist the average grocery shopper with his/her weekly grocery runs, it aims to improve the shopper’s overall experience by saving money and time.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Task Analysis</h3>
            <p>We want to provide users with a comprehensive way to enjoy their shopping experience by alleivating this process.</p>
            <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/HTAdiagram.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>

             <h3>Design Ideas</h3>
						 <p>As a team, we evaluated different ways to carry out this system.</p>

           <h3>Idea #1: Mobile</h3>
           <p> One of the major problems we are striving to solve is the lack of a central system wherein users can monitor and develop their shopping lists. A mobile application would directly solve this problem as users could use a single app as their one-stop shop for all their shopping needs. Since the app can be downloaded onto each individual’s smartphone, the user would be able to open the app at any point in the day to track their shopping habits and determine what items they may need to purchase. Additionally, since most grocery shoppers have smartphones, the app would be available to a majority of the intended user base.</p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/phonestoryboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>Idea #2: In-Store Kiosk</h3>
					 <p>The second design alternative is an in-store kiosk. Unlike the phone application, the user would only interact with the kiosk while at the grocery store. This reduces the time and attention required by the user outside of the store. Additionally, since the kiosks would be placed within individual stores, the data collected as well as presented to the user would be more personalized and unique to the specific grocery store. In this case, the grocery stores would engage in a partnership program with the GottaGrocery team to help develop the in-store kiosk infrastructure.</p>
					 <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/kioskstoryboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>Idea #3: Wearable Glasses</h3>

           <p>The third design alternative we chose to explore is a form of wearable glasses technology. Wearable glasses are fairly rare, especially when considering grocery shopping. We wanted to examine a design alternative which would be entirely different from what users would generally expect to see. The glasses would provide a much more immersive experience for users; allowing them to have a more seamless interaction with the GottaGrocery system. These glasses would not be sold separately, and instead, similar to the in-store kiosk, will be available for users to pick up only at the grocery store itself. Similar to the kiosk system, the stores would enter into a partnership agreement with GottaGrocery to help develop the wearable-dispensing stations.</p>
					 <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/GottaGroceryScreen.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>Pros and Cons of Each Idea?</h3>
					 <p>We developed the pros and cons and decided to go with kiosk because the live-in store experience for the customer. The experience would only start in store and would end when they leave. As well as, we could encourage users to actually interact with the product if the kiosk was readily available within a store, as opposed to an app to download and remember to use.
</p>

					<h3> Kiosk Screens</h3>
					<p>We developed a competitive analysis on how similar systems formatted their app. Systems like Free Shopping List Ease, Ibotta,Cozi Family organizers, Mealboard and Buy Me a Pie.</p>
					<p><b>Free Shopping List Ease:</b> Allows you to create a list of groceries you have and a list for those you need. Yet, all of this has to be manually done by clicking on the list and typing in the name of each item or having to scan each of them individually. Such a tedious task can be eliminated by simply scanning the receipt and uploading the items to the list. </p>
					<p><b>Ibotta:</b> Excellent for getting cash back on items at the grocery store, since it works with leading brands and retailers to help users take advantage of easy savings without having to worry about carrying around clipped coupons. This does not integrate the grocery list system because it only suggests discounted items that the user would possibly buy. </p>
					<p><b>Cozi Family Organizer:</b> Organizes lists for the family to have and one can add other family members (users) to their group so that everyone can see the daily chores, tasks, and errands such as getting groceries. This app is tangential to ours because it utilizes the idea of making lists, but there is nothing proprietary about it. <p>
					<p><b>Mealboard:</b> Touches somewhat the same consumer-base our app is trying to appeal to. For instance, it generates lists without manually putting in the item’s name. However, it is different such that it produces the list by first asking the user which recipe they would like to inquire about. This app could be a good contender for potential partnerships. </p>
           <p><b>Buy Me a Pie!:</b> Cuts down on time spent cruising through aisles via an auto-sort feature. The major downside of this application is that the app does not allow unlimited ability to customize categories, so that each actual aisle for a grocery store can be set up.</p>
					 <p>Overall, the other systems forget to appeal to or discuss how users tend to always forget a few key items for their weekly meals. Similarly, no application has yet been created that reads off and scans from the coupon itself. </p>
					 <p>Studying the design of these apps, we liked how the apps tabbed their sections and included pictures of their items.</p>
					 <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/screens.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>User Testing</h3>
						 <p>We conducted a usabilty test on the screens to see how easy it was to understand.<p>
							 <h4>Procedure</h4>
							 <ol>
								 <li>We read a script to our participants describing what our application does and what we would like the users to do with our prototype.</li>
									<li>We first asked the user to go through the first task which was to add mozzarella sticks to the cart and then print the receipt, while we video recorded them completing the task</li>
									<li>Next, for our second benchmark task, we asked the user to locate the points system page in the app in order to determine whether or not it was intuitive.</li>
									<li>We then interviewed the users about the tasks they completed in order to garner a better idea of what they thought about our application’s aesthetic, functionality, and navigation as well as any suggestions they have to improve it.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>**While the user was performing each task, we took notes about how the user was reacting and interacting to our prototype.</p>

							<h4>Task 1: Adding an item to the cart and printing the Receipt </h4>
							<p>In this task the user has to go through our application, find the frozen mozzarella sticks, add them to the cart and then then print their receipt. </p>
							<h4>Task 2: Finding the Points System</h4>
							<p>The points system is what incentives our customers to come back to the kiosk, we asked our users to locate where the points page may be.</p>
							<h3>Interview Questions</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>How likely would be to actually use such a system while grocery shopping?(on a scale of 1-5, 5 being most likely)</li>
								<li>Which of these issues was the biggest problem in using the application?</li>
								<li>What did you like the most about this application?</li>
								<li>What else would you like to see included in the application?</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>Results</h3>
							<h4><b>Time to Add an Item to Cart</b></h4>
							<p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/addItemtocart.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
							<h4><b>Quotes</b></h4>
							<p><i>“It might be better to add a search bar, so that it’s easier for users to browse for specific items without having to look through a bunch of pages.”</i></p>
							<p><i>“I think adding a ‘Related Items’</i></p>
							<br>

							<h4><b>Time to Locate Points Page</b></h4>
							<p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/pointspage.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
							<h4><b>Quotes</b></h4>
							<p><i>“The star might not be the best indicator for the points system page because I initially thought it led to a Favorites screen.”</i></p>
							<br>

							<p>Based on these results we knew we needed to fix our search mechanism. Multiple times user looked for the the suggested item in the wrong section. Our time to find items was also too high, we knew adding a search functionality would decrease this time. We also decided to add text to some of our options so that the clarity of the options was that much more clear.</p>

						<h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
						 <ol>
							 <li>User Tests. If your tests reveal no problems, you probably did them wrong. There were times I wanted to test things I knew worked, but my made sure we only tested things that could pose as a potential problem and were CORE to our product.</li>
							 <li>Ideation. I first wanted to create an app when we first tried to solve this problem, but its important to keep problems user-centric not product centric. From this activity, I understood why a kiosk was more user-centric then an app. </li>
