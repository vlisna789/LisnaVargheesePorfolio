					<p>GottaGrocery main purpose as a system is to assist the average grocery shopper with his/her weekly grocery runs, it aims to improve the shopper’s overall experience by saving money and time.</p>

					<div class="testimony animate-box">
							<h3>Overview of System</h3>
              <p>Our system aims to create a more seamless experience for the average grocery shopper. This application serves to make sure the user saves time and money while shopping, by keeping a log of what the user usually buys. After each trip to the grocery store, the user uploads the receipt. The app will</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>recognize these products and remind the shopper what he or she usually buys at that location</li>
							  <li>look for discounts on what the user normally buys and suggest similar items</li>
							  <li>recommend when the user may need to go grocery shopping again</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>Why does this matter?</b>This will prevent the user from forgetting items after shopping and will help them save money while shopping. For the grocery store who participates in this system, users are more likely to return to that store after having a pleasant experience. As a system that is trying to assist the average grocery shopper with his/her weekly grocery runs, it aims to improve the shopper’s overall experience by saving money and time.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>Task Analysis</h3>
            <p>We want to provide users with a comprehensive way to enjoy their shopping experience by alleivating this process.</p>
            <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/HTAdiagram.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>

             <h3>Design Ideas</h3>
						 <p>As a team, we evaluated different ways to carry out this system.</p>

           <h3>Idea #1: Mobile</h3>
           <p> One of the major problems we are striving to solve is the lack of a central system wherein users can monitor and develop their shopping lists. A mobile application would directly solve this problem as users could use a single app as their one-stop shop for all their shopping needs. Since the app can be downloaded onto each individual’s smartphone, the user would be able to open the app at any point in the day to track their shopping habits and determine what items they may need to purchase. Additionally, since most grocery shoppers have smartphones, the app would be available to a majority of the intended user base.</p>
           <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/phonestoryboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>Idea #2: In-Store Kiosk</h3>
					 <p>The second design alternative is an in-store kiosk. Unlike the phone application, the user would only interact with the kiosk while at the grocery store. This reduces the time and attention required by the user outside of the store. Additionally, since the kiosks would be placed within individual stores, the data collected as well as presented to the user would be more personalized and unique to the specific grocery store. In this case, the grocery stores would engage in a partnership program with the GottaGrocery team to help develop the in-store kiosk infrastructure.</p>
					 <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/kioskstoryboard.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <h3>Idea #3: Wearable Glasses</h3>

           <p>The third design alternative we chose to explore is a form of wearable glasses technology. Wearable glasses are fairly rare, especially when considering grocery shopping. We wanted to examine a design alternative which would be entirely different from what users would generally expect to see. The glasses would provide a much more immersive experience for users; allowing them to have a more seamless interaction with the GottaGrocery system. These glasses would not be sold separately, and instead, similar to the in-store kiosk, will be available for users to pick up only at the grocery store itself. Similar to the kiosk system, the stores would enter into a partnership agreement with GottaGrocery to help develop the wearable-dispensing stations.</p>

					 <h3>Pros and Cons of Each Idea?</h3>
					 <p class="animate-box"><img src="images/GottaGrocery/prosandcons.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Free HTML5 Template by FreeHTML5.co"></p>
					 <p>We developed the pros and cons and decided to go with kiosk because the live in experience for the customer in the store and it didn’t include a user having a to download another app. As well as, we could encourage users to actually interact with the product if the kiosk was readily available within a store.

						<h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
						 <ol>
							 <li>Managing people and crisis control. I had to deal with a lot of situations that required creative planning and work arounds that were not planned for. With school and time contraints, I learned how to handle situations with grace.</li>
							 <li>Handling critiques. I knew that this type of work was highly subjective. An auidence memeber needs to understand my story. That meant hearing what others had to say, figuring out what they meant and taking it to heart. My ultimate job was to provide a show, not feed my ego.  </li>
							 <li> How to tell a story. Being a dance captain meant understanding the difference between cheap displays of story telling and subtle notes. I had to learn what an auidence would have fun figuring out and what they would find cheesy. Part of show design is to convince the auidence they found the story on their own.</li>
